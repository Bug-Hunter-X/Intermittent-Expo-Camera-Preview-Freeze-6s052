This bug occurs when using the Expo Camera API with custom camera controls.  The issue is that the camera preview freezes or becomes unresponsive after a certain amount of time, or after specific actions, such as switching between cameras or changing camera settings.  The app doesn't crash, but the preview remains frozen and no further camera operations are possible, requiring a full app restart. This isn't a consistent behavior and is difficult to reliably reproduce, making debugging particularly challenging.  The Camera component's state seems to become stuck.
